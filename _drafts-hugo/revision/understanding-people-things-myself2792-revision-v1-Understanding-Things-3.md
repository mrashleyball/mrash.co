Hey friends,

This letter is about kindness &amp; understanding. July is a month to highlight kindness and one way we can do that is to show empathy toward others.

Understand what people are going through and be sensitive enough to show kindness.

I hope youâ€™re doing well and are staying safe out there in our contactless world. Please reply to this email if you have any questions.

## My Misunderstandings Of Business

Here are some healthy reflections on my past five years of being in the small business space:

1. Money, money, money Thinking business is ALL about money is not fair. Itâ€™s far more meaningful than increasing bottom lines. I missed the two fundamentals of business here. Solving problems and serving an audience better.
2. No one else is scared Everyoneâ€™s scared at some point. Just because people are successful, intelligent and educated does not mean theyâ€™re not emotional human beings.
3. Thereâ€™s a finish line, and itâ€™s amazingly wonderful!!! Business is like life, it keeps adapting and changing, so learn to adapt with it. Iâ€™m treating things more like a marathon than a sprint these days, working on my stamina training.

This letter began as an article, but I quickly realised itâ€™s not for my target audience. Rather this is something Iâ€™d like to share with my friends here.

## Writing, Opening Up &amp; Other Things

This week Iâ€™ve been grateful for writing. Iâ€™ve had feelings of anxiety and emposter syndrome hit at random times. Writing has been a coping mechanism to understanding emotions and control thoughts.

Thank you writing.

Iâ€™ve learnt this week that being honest and valuing people is a great strength. We can get hurt by others which stops us from trusting and continuing to open up to friends or those we work with.

Mastering the skill of balance, thatâ€™s the goal. Balancing who we trust with what we open up about is a tricky thing. Opening up to everyone about everything is a sure disaster and then closing ourselves off is a decent into depression.

Iâ€™m very thankful for Luke Hawley, a friend and colleague who I work closely with. Thanks Luke.

Iâ€™m currently reading Company of One by Paul Jarvis who was last weekâ€™s person of interest in the letters. Absolutely loving his work and has become a bit of hero of mine. His values both personally and professionally are very admirable.

As far as content is concerned, last week I published [a guide on hiring a freelance web designer.](https://mrash.co/hiring-a-freelance-web-designer-a-guide-for-small-business-owners/) Iâ€™m noticing my articles are definitely improving and I believe this is the best one Iâ€™ve wrote thus far.

Iâ€™ve been working on some freelance projects, finished up [focusmediafilm.com](http://focusmediafilm.com) &amp; am starting [fortheloveeeofflowers.com](http://fortheloveeeofflowers.com) soon!

I hope everyone has had a nice week, remember to be kind to others and focus on the ones we love.

Have a good weekend friends ðŸ‘‹

â€” Ash
