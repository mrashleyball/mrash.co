It’s nice writing to you again, I hope you had a nice break over the holidays. As more people ([like Aussies](https://www.abs.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/year-covid-19-and-australians-work-home-more)) are working from home more than ever before, myself included, let’s discuss having a healthy home work-life.

## Healthy Home Work-Life

If you’re working part-time at home, it’s a great balance between the office and waking up just before clock-in time. I spent 2021 part-time working from home, and now in 2022, I’m home full-time. Here are seven tips I’ve discovered from having the office across the hallway.

1. Keep the same work routine.
2. Have clear, mental work/home barriers.
3. Don’t lose contact with work colleagues.
4. If needed, take smaller, regular breaks.
5. Keep motivated, keep moving,
6. Stay hydrated, keep a water bottle close.
7. Let house-mates know your work hours.

What about you? How are you finding a healthy Home Work-Life balance? Reply, I’d love to hear from you.

Thanks for reading the Healthy Home Work-Life newsletter for Jan 2022, I hope you enjoyed it. Personally, I love working from home and I’m striving to keep up the good work-life balance. Sure, it’s only been a month, but with a bit more discipline, I’m much happier compared to working at an office. Until next time, thanks again.

Kind regards,

Ash
