So I’ve tested a lot of image optimising tools for various projects over the years. Everything from Photoshop to WordPress Plugins, and as of late 2019 I’ve finally found my favourite Free Image Optimising Tool (and method).

Optimising images needs to be two things, easy and fast. I don’t want to waste time tinkering with multiple settings behind option walls just to export all the images the wrong way… then to do it all over again.

I should add the third requirement, the image optimising tool actually needs to optimise, like really optimise. I want to see those MB’s be KB’s and those KB’s be as little as possible.

# Best Image Optimising Tool: Assetizer

Assetizer ([web link](https://assetizr.com/)) is a lightweight program for windows that is (as of writing this in late 2019) absolutely free. That’s not just dollars free, it’s also privacy free, what I mean by that is, you don’t need to give up your name and email for it.

The method is hyper simple, drag desired images to be optimised into Assetizer and the tool does its job. It outputs the images to a Aesstizer folder in the default image library. You can change the output folder via settings if you desire. There you can easily copy paste out your new shiny web images.

I’ve seen an incredible size difference in Unsplash and Pexel images, high quality jpgs 10Mb+ down to 100’s of Kb’s in under a few seconds or so. Not only giving an amazing result, but the speed is a ‘blink and you’ll miss it’ feeling.
