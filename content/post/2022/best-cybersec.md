Let's look back at the last 31 days, discuss the best way to learn cyber security and I’ll share a new project I’m working on. *Disclaimer, you’ve received this [newsletter](https://mrash.co/newsletters) as you subscribed to [Mr Ash .co](https://mrashleyball.com/).*

## the BEST way to learn CyberSec?!

If you want into CyberSec then get into Capture The Flags (CTFs), simple. CTFs are gamified learning, I mean, why do people spend so many hours playing video games? Gaming is a lot of fun even when it's challenging, hence *gamified* learning.

I participated in two live CTFs in October from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) respectively. Both were free, online, beginner-friendly and could be played solo. Plus, I learnt a ton of new things like command injection, packet analysis and blue team forensics.

These (and other) CTFs inspired my new project *drum roll* [100daysofctfs.com](https://100daysofctfs.com/), a site dedicated to organising CTFs for fellow beginners. For additional resources, see [CTF Time](https://ctftime.org/) for live CTF events and [Roppers CTF Bootcamp](https://www.roppers.org/courses/ctf) for the best CTF course imo. 

## Let’s Catch-Up

**Month’s Memories**

- We road-tripped to a rural country town inland, 12 hours there and back in one day. Ah, the things we do for friends.
- I'm in the process of moving mrash.co to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), expect article delays.
- I switched internet and phone providers to ‘Mate’, bye-bye Kogan and Aldi Mobile. Also, I've dumbed my phone down by removing apps, unused services and going greyscale, my wife HATES it.
- I published four videos: [Bandit 0-4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjiG4CYxXgw), [Bandit 5-9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGQXj5MAVss), [Bandit 10-14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZJTmWjEevM), and [Bandit 15-19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEzGoZuQS1s). And four articles: [OverTheWire Bandit](https://mrash.co/overthewire-bandit/), [100 Days of Hacking](https://mrash.co/100daysofhacking/), [Crack the Hash](https://mrash.co/crack-the-hash-tryhackme-walkthrough/), and [How To Fix OpenVPN for TryHackMe](https://mrash.co/how-to-fix-tryhackme-vpn-not-working-troubleshooting-openvpn/).

It's been a long month of working, learning and creating content. I don't think I've ever been so optimistic for the end of the year. 

*Keep to your course.*
