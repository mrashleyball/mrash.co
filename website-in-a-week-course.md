### “Web Design Is Hard” – Unclear Pathways

The barrier to learn web design and create websites is at an all-time low, anyone can download WordPress running local server software and start with front-end web design. The problem is the path to creating and executing a high-quality website, it’s a tricky one.

Learning web design (like other areas in technology) is not always straight forward because there are so many paths to get to the end destination. A way to think about this is like climbing a ladder, we expect learning to be one step/level at a time, however, it can be more like rock climbing where there are multiple paths to reach the top.

I’ve climbed a lot of different paths, tried various front-end builders and themes all in an effort to find my ladder. Now I can confidently lean my ladder on the rock wall and safely climb up to the destination, one step at a time.

### “How Do I Start?” – Lack of Guidance 

I’ve found becoming comfortable in the freelance space difficult, due to lack of guidance as it’s not always easy to find content or courses that suit certain learning styles and schedules. It’s tough to learn new tech skills when you’re on your own. Did you know that online courses have a drop off rate of less than 10%?

People want to learn but find it difficult to stick at it.

The web design process can throw lots of spanners in your work, odd issues and random problems. There are a lot of decisions to be made and can become overwhelming and confusing quite quickly.

### Enter the ‘Website In A Week’ Course

It’s true, there’s no better way to learn than through experience, try and fail, rinse and repeat. Well here is your experience and hands-on learning! This is another climb in your web design journey or at the very least your ‘I have a website set up and can get back to what else I need to do’ journey.

As my students have told me, a helpful hand is always welcome when learning. That’s why I’m here, to help you out when you need it. This course is self-paced and designed to work in with your schedule, but it also is drip-fed to you so you can follow.

### My Story

Back in 2014 I studied web technologies which led me down the fantastic journey of freelancing. I began creating WordPress websites for a variety of clients and have had great highs and lesson-packed lows. I’ve learnt what good design is, how to implement it, and have developed a strategic website project process.

Learn from my freelancing journey while getting to create your own website along the way!

During my freelance career, I stumbled into a teaching position within a local college here in Australia, who knew all those hours building and researching computer parts would pay off into a job! My unique situation allows me to harvest my teaching toolkit while travelling on my freelancing journey.

I’d like to share the web design lessons I’ve learnt with you!
