This is my experience while learning JavaScript.

My live notes can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/mrashleyball/JavaScipt-1ff05ec6a84f4938b37dba7f04c7f948)

My goal is to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript to create some basic web apps.

I’m using a curriculum from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org) while following along with their video tutorial [Learn JavaScript – Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/PkZNo7MFNFg).

See my live notes on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/mrashleyball/JavaScipt-1ff05ec6a84f4938b37dba7f04c7f948) for more detail.

My process for learning has been as follows:

1. Watch video
2. Take notes
3. Participate in curriculum

I’ve found the curriculum to be very clear with simple instructions to follow.

## Some background…

I’ve always had a love/hate relationship with coding.

On the one hand, it fascinates me with its mystery and magic but on the other, it can be very confusing.

I’ve never found a true purpose for coding in my professional journey unless you count fixing up some CSS issues in WordPress.

I guess I should clarify…

## My experience with code

Back when I was studying Web Technology I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS, loved it!

I believe anyone dealing with WordPress or Web Design should know basic web code.

Understanding the makeup of web pages is essential, otherwise, you’re moving around elements with no real comprehension.

I’m not a whizz with HTML or CSS by any means, honestly, I could use a couple of refresher courses (which is on my to-do list).

It’s been a few years since I’ve worked purely in code because you don’t need too.

## You don’t need to know code?

No! To clarify, you don’t need to work in pure web code, but you still should know basic HTML &amp; CSS.

The power of Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress makes manipulating web code a breeze.

Power a WordPress with a page builder like Elementor and you got yourself Photoshop for web design, pretty awesome.

Of course, it depends on what you’re doing. Most micro-small businesses out there are totally fine with WordPress.
