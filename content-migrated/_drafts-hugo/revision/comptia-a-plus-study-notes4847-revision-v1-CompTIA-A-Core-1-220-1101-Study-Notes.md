## Installing Hardware &amp; Display Components

### Hardware and Device Replacement

- RAM: system memory or desk of PC, fast access, low amount = lower access speeds, volatile.
- Storage: file cabinet of PC, slower access, static (non-volatile).
- Check MoBo user guide to ensure RAM amount, form-factor etc.
- GPU/Video Card: processes video and connects to external monitors.
- CPU: brain of PC.

### Hard Drive Migration

- SSD: non-volatile flash memory for storage, faster, reliable, less power, quieter, smaller.
- Upgrading: check form factor, check cables, install OS.
- Cloning: specific software copies drive.

### HDD/SSD Replacement

- Prepare: back up data, create a recovery disk, have the right tools.
- Remove drive: power down, anti-static mat, open PC, disconnect cables etc.
- Install new drive: reverse remove process.

mSATA: mini Serial Advanced Technology Attachment

### Wireless Cards

- USB: no cables, no install, no upgrade needed.
- Bluetooth: peripharel, personal area network (pan), PC (PCMCIA) card/slot, USB dongle.
- Mini PCI: 124-pin edge connector, square shape, older.
- \*Mini PCIe: 54-pin. rectangular, any device on architecture works.
- Cellular: anywhere access, built-in mobile broadband, USB.
- Replacing: turn off, remove card, remove screws. Reverse process to complete.

PCIe: Peripheral Component Interconnect (Express)

### Physical Privacy and Security Components

Biometrics: fingerprint, voice, facial etc.

- Fingerprints: most common, scanning pad, stored in secure DB.
- Facial: identify a face, requires a camera, verification based on math DB.
- Iris/retinal: typically external device, physical access to facilities.
- Voice: less common, easier to hack.
- NFC: extension of RFID, very short, quick sync, payments.
    - NFC vs BT: no pairing, short-range security, less interference.

NFC: Near Field Communication RFID: Radio Frequency Identification

### Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)

Common in laptop/flat panels, replaced CRTs

- Design: liquid crystal, between plastic, light source, divided into tiny squares or pixels.
- Scenes: 32-bit colour (16 million), pixel high by wide resolutions, DPI means pixels per inch.
- Lighting: Cold cathode fluorescent light (CCFL) or Light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
    - CCFL: requires inverters DC to AC.
    - LED: uses DC
- Performance: Response time (ms).
- LCD Versions: In-plane switching (IPS), super plane to line switching (PLS), Vertical Alignment (VA), twisted nematic (TN), transistor translator logic (TTL).
    - IPS: best overall.
    - PLS: by Samsung, more power, brighter.
    - VA: inbetween IPS and PLS
    - TN: for gamers.
    - TTL: digital signals only, not common.

Pixels: Picture Elements DPI: Dots per inch – used in printing. PPI: Pixel per inch – used in monitors/screens.

### Organic Light-emitting Diode (OLED)

Organic compounds, passing electricity through light through TFT, anode/cathode.

- Passive-matrix OLED (PMOLED) or Active-matrix OLEX (AMOLED).
    - PMOLED: one row at a time without using TFT, pixels off most of the time, decreases life.
    - AMOLED: brighter, better option.
- OLED vs LED LCD: controlled on a pixel-by-pixel basis, compared to edge lighting.
- Colour:
- Viewing Angles: OLED is better, IPS LCD is better.
- Brightness: LED LCD is better, nits or lumen is higher the brighter.
- Contrast: measured in contrast ratio, OLED offers higher contrast.

### Mobile Display Components

- LCD Advantages: lightweight, low power consumption, inexpensive.
- LCD Disadvantages: no true black, colour matching, losing backlight.
- OLED: expensive, increase battery use.
- Touchscreen: digitzier fingers.
- Antenna: in-screen, multiple types.
- Webcam: standard in laptops/phones, built-in sound.
- Microphone: integrated, general purpose-fit.

### Wi-Fi Antenna Connectors

- Location: wrapped around laptop displays, more durable, improves range and performance.
- Poor Performance: antenna booster, range extender or change location of devices.

### Webcams and Microphones

Video comms, image quality, frame rate.

- USB Webcams: portability, compatibility, attachments.
- Microphone: embedded in the case, more sensitive, noise/quality. Headset, drivers/apps.

### Laptop Screen Inverters

CCFL: LCD monitors, neon signs, computer case lighting.

- A small tube, less damaged, uses defues to spread light.
- Needs inverter, increases weight and temperature.

LEDs: Semiconductor emits light, panel backlight, fibre optics and indicator lights.

- Doesn’t need an inverter, efficient, minimal heat, long life, quality.

### Digitizers and Touchscreen

Digitizer: any device taking analogue input and outputting digital signals. Process of digitization.

- Tablets/Phones: finger, stylus etc. are inputs.
- Touch Screens: laptops, monitors, kiosks etc.
    - Formats: built-in or standalone.

Digitizer Example: Microphones use a thin, metal diaphragm that vibrates in response to sound waves, then passed to a recording device.
