- [Streamline Your Business Processes](http://youtu.be/A7Pc3vcAvBM)

It’s that last one I really want to highlight because no matter if you’re a web designer or a shoe shiner, business processes are important to your success.

In the Webinar with Ben Pines, Paul talks about three of the crucial key processes in a business:

1. Onboarding – Automate the process, vet leads using score cards
2. Starting &amp; Finishing Projects – Stick to deadlines and stand by your word
3. Growth – Always have an exit strategy, start small and slowly raise rates

He also touches on the importance of effective communication and leveling out your income to avoid waves of money.

If you want to stay in contact with him, he’s never had a Facebook profile, so his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pjrvs) is where it’s at. Also checkout his book ‘Company of One’, I just got it myself and have started reading!

## A Natural Fit For Myself

In just two weeks, I’ve found a new passion in writing about others. It’s obvious to me when I’m waking up in the morning and am naturally picking up my phone to write more about amazing people, I love it!

Since last week, I’m really simplfying these letters, instead of multiple sections and headings its just now in two parts, others &amp; myself.

This week I’ve been grateful for my work and my team mates. Going back into Semester Two with a new class of students is always a bit daunting. If it wasn’t for the constant support of the teachers I work with, I’d feel alone and struggle in my position.

### Story Time

My beautiful wife, Shar, tutors school students everything from maths to music, she’s an absolute talent. As I’m getting ready to walk out the door to get to my class, I can’t help but listen in on her nine year old student asking her what she did over the holidays. After a few holiday details, Shar mentions we ate a lot, it’s true, we did. Oh the innocence and tact of children, he replies with “Oh, are you chunky now?”, we absolutely cracked up laughing. He didn’t have an ounce of negativity in the question, he just wanted to know.

### What I’ve Been Creating

A couple of weeks ago I made a video talking about a new design tool called Crello. Highly recommend checking it out if you create visual designs for social media, websites and other digital means (even print!).

Well I made a step by step guide to doing it. [Check out the article here.](https://mrash.co/how-to-setup-your-own-website-a-complete-guide-to-hosting-a-wordpress-website/)

I’ve also just published an article for [small business owners looking to hire a freelance web designer](http://mrash.co/hiring-a-freelance-web-designer-a-guide-for-small-business-owners)

Thanks for reading 👋

P.S. I’m working on creating a storage area for our letters. They will be easily accessible on my website if you missed a topic or want to catch up on something you missed.

I’m also going to create a feedback area for those wanting to help with ideas for future correspondence.
