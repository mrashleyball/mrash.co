Let‚Äôs go for another [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) room, this time we‚Äôre tackling [OhSINT](https://tryhackme.com/room/ohsint), which begs the question ‚Äúare you able to use open-source intelligence to solve this challenge?‚Äù

This was a fun, different room for me, I love the idea of OSINT and using the web to solve challenges. Despite having a few initial issues along the way, it was fun to answer ‚Äúwhat information can you possible get with just one photo?‚Äù

*Disclaimer, there are spoilers for this room below, please use the hints if you do not want any steps spoiled.*

## Hints

Here are some helpful hints if you need a bit of a nudge without any spoilers.

- What is this users avatar of? Check the metadata of the image, then use a search engine.
- What city is this person in? Use search results based on the metadata.
- Whats the SSID of the WAP he connected to? Zoom in on the city found.
- What is his personal email address? Check all profiles.
- What site did you find his email address on? Did you check?
- Where has he gone on holiday? Again, check each profile found.
- What is this persons password? Right-click, inspect.

## Steps

1. Enumerate image using `file`. ![https://p146.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/llu0EwLv/8e5a9af0-1bd5-400c-a7b0-a54f1834b5b0.jpeg?v=ddada66672d624c871a6f0916d13d85f](https://p146.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/llu0EwLv/8e5a9af0-1bd5-400c-a7b0-a54f1834b5b0.jpeg?v=ddada66672d624c871a6f0916d13d85f)
2. More enumeration using `exiftool WindowsXP.jpg` ![https://p146.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/xQuwqv28/775a3765-c64b-4e4c-ab25-3ace2f770f0a.jpeg?v=89d301d262a1343f4dbc9a04bedebb56](https://p146.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/xQuwqv28/775a3765-c64b-4e4c-ab25-3ace2f770f0a.jpeg?v=89d301d262a1343f4dbc9a04bedebb56)
3. Use a search engine to find information about each profile based on the metadata above. Note, something I even missed the second time around, see the metadata in the search results. ![https://p146.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/RBumn0QZ/6c5c8dc7-af30-4ae9-a2f1-8299c3ea3369.jpeg?v=90f04c7cecd1c1e62d27459f05813902](https://p146.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/RBumn0QZ/6c5c8dc7-af30-4ae9-a2f1-8299c3ea3369.jpeg?v=90f04c7cecd1c1e62d27459f05813902)
4. Based on the information found on each profile/site, use [wigle.net](http://wigle.net) to search the BSSID. Take your time, unlike me who rushed and missed the purple circle on the city. ![https://p146.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/YEukrvnx/4eb58239-0c29-41e1-96b5-f304043fc4d7.jpeg?v=929909124e698525a3942eccaf62dfb5](https://p146.p4.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/YEukrvnx/4eb58239-0c29-41e1-96b5-f304043fc4d7.jpeg?v=929909124e698525a3942eccaf62dfb5)
    1. Continue to search each site/profile for this user to answer the last challenges. Use the hints above or the notes below for more, if you‚Äôre really stuck, see the video walkthrough.

## Reflection

As I said in the video I made a few mistakes in this room the first time around the twist‚Ä¶ and I even missed something the second time too. There‚Äôs a good lesson in there to slow down and observe more with OSINT. Sometimes clues are right in front of us and skimming doesn‚Äôt help, a bad habit I do a lot.

The last challenge was a bit annoying if I‚Äôm being honest. It‚Äôs not a big deal and even though it‚Äôs not realistic, there‚Äôs a good lesson in there‚Ä¶ somewhere. I think as my first OSINT room, it was really good, I‚Äôm very keen to do more challenges like this.

I was expecting a lot more involvement with the initial image, in fact, I thought most of the room was going to revolve around it. It was good using search engines though, it can be an underlooked skill when starting off in Cyber Sec.

So there it is, OhSINT, I hope you enjoyed this write-up and feel free to check out the YouTube channel for more video walkthroughs. Have a great day!
