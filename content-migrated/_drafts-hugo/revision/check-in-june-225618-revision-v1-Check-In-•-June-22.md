We’ve passed 2022’s halfway point, how about a check-in? Let’s talk about goals, work, courses and current learning path. *Disclaimer, this newsletter is from Mr Ash (that’s me), and you’re subscribed or downloaded a freebie.

## Checking In, Halfway Point

It’s been a good year so far, I completed TryHackMe’s Beginner Path and it spawned me starting up YouTube again. Let’s look at the Key Point Indicators (KPIs) in a bit more detail.

- [Newsletter](https://mrash.co/newsletters) friends: 200 (+6%) – hit the double hundred mark, this was the yearly target so happy to hit it this soon. I love writing my newsletter month to month, but find the lack of engagement a bit discouraging tbh.
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/mrashleyball) subscribers: 496 (+18%) – just under five hundred, already surpassed the yearly goal of four hundred. So far, it’s been really fun getting comments and watching more people enjoy the videos, keen to do more throughout the year.
- [Blog](https://mrashleyball.com/blog/) views, visitors: 1150 (-36%), 612 (-12%) – after a steady increase, the blog has dipped in the last 2-3 months. I’m unsure why, I’m not sure if it’s just from the tracking software and web caching clashing as I’ve had this issue in the past. Whatever the case, I’m trying to not worry too much about numbers lowering. The largest referrer month to month is always Google Search, by far. While uploading more videos to YouTube, I have seen this as my second top referrer to the blog, which makes sense as the first and second most popular search engine.

All up, I’m very proud of sharing what I learn each week/month via my channels. I know it ain’t much, but it’s honest work.

## Catch-Up &amp; Next Steps
