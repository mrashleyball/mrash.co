## Getting Help

Do you need help? I know I do and we all do at some stage in our lives.

Maybe you find it difficult to get help or even embarrassing. Please don’t, if you need help, just talk to someone. Asking for help and receiving it can be life changing and even life saving.

Since April I’ve been feeling lost, I’d have a few good days and then some bad. But I found the window between the good days and bad we’re shortening, I was feeling worse more often.

So I reached out to a free, professional councilor. Here’s what I learnt:

1. Talking to a professional isn’t a big deal and it’s not embarrassing.
2. It doesn’t have to be a long-term, ongoing conversation.
3. You don’t have to trudge up your entire life and go through your childhood.
4. Talking to someone outside of your life is empowering and motivating.
5. There’s a “snowball effect” from talking, I’ve felt lighter and had less brain fog.

As someone who suffers from imposter syndrome, low self-esteem and social anxiety, I can say “getting help” helps.

If you need to talk to a professional, search “I need to talk to someone” or “professional councillors near me” to see local results to you and your country. If you just want to chat, my inbox is always open.

## Catch-Up &amp; Next Steps

**Months Memories**

- My wife and I started Hello Fresh. Weekly recipes delivered to our door all proportioned and ready to cook. So far we’re loving it, sure it’s more expensive but it’s helping us eat and cook better.
- My little (6.7ft) bro-in-law started playing basketball. It’s fun going back to the court I played at when I was younger.
- Work was busy as usual, we have new classes every 6-8 weeks. I started creating videos for my units and updated our graphics.
- I finally finished CS50P, the single hardest course I’ve ever got through. It’s been quite the learning journey, here’s [my final project submission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoEHd3VtJ9E).
- Replit held a EdFest 2022 event, which had the likes of [David Malan](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/) (CS50) and [Qunicy Larson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/quincylarson/) (freecodecamp). It was awesome so I submitted a course outline to their curriculum jam [here](https://mrash.co/replit-edfest-2022-jam-intro-to-pyscript/).
- Since CS50P, I’ve started putting my Python skills to work building web apps with PyScript. So far I’m 3 projects deep, all are still a work in progress. 1) [Mailto Me](https://mailto-me.mrash.co/), 2) [LightShot Leaks](https://lightshot-leaks.mrash.co/) and 3) [I Was There](https://iwasthere.mrash.co/). I’d love feedback on any one or all of them!
