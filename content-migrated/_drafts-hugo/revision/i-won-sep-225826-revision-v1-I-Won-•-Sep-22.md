We’ve made it to October so let’s recap last month and catch up. Here’s a quick story I wanted to share with you about my first coding competition. *Disclaimer, you’ve received this [newsletter](https://mrash.co/newsletters) as you subscribed to [Mr Ash .co](https://mrashleyball.com/). Note, the [August newsletter](https://mrash.co/letter/afk-aug-22/) wasn’t published via email but is now live.*

## I Won My First Coding Competition

It’s early July and I’m scrolling Discord where I find myself on the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) server. There’s a lot of new coders asking questions about Python, JavaScript and so on. But the event channel caught my eye, for the month of July there’s a Summer Event. All I have to do is make an open-source app and submit it.

Lucky for me I just finished [CS50P](https://mrash.co/cs50-python-problem-set-guide/) and started a small series of web apps. I tried smaller scripts like [Cowsays What CTF](https://mrash.co/cowsays-what-ctf/), but nothing that felt like an app. Basically, I want to build something that solves a problem.

First was [Mailto Me](https://mailto-me.mrash.co/) which is a way to automate templates within a link, it’s something that we needed at work. Then [LightShot Leaks](https://lightshot-leaks.mrash.co/) was less about solving a problem and more about shedding light on a privacy issue. But then I made [I Was There](https://iwasthere.mrash.co/) which actually does solve a big issue in education, easily generated event certificates.

‘I Was There’ became my submission which landed me in second place. I won 3 free courses including Python, PHP and JavaScript exams to get certified, plus 6 months of their premium service.

I’ve never got involved in time-based comps, but now I’m looking at live cyber-based CTFs. I’d love to win some prizes to get certified in pen testing and who knows what else!

## Catch-Up

**Months Memories**

- We got away on a holiday in North Queensland. I highly recommend Port Douglass, Mossman Gorge, Green Island and Skyrail/Train around Cairns.
- Sold my car, and now my wife and I are down to a single mode of transportation… a mid-sized SUV to fit the imaginary kids.
- My wife and I are working on our morning routine which involves getting up earlier, walking together and focusing on our shared mental health. It’s been really nice forming better habits together.
- Struggled with video game addiction again and ended up uninstalling one problematic game. Sometimes cutting off a bad habit is the only way forward.
- Published 1) [Crack The Hash LIVE!](https://youtu.be/euiuIzHaiLk) with a written write-up coming soon. And 2) [AFK • Aug 22](https://mrash.co/letter/afk-aug-22/), the forgotten newsletter.

September was a great ‘break month’ leaving me feeling refreshed and optimistic for October. Big shout out to a past YouTuber Travis from DevTips for [this video](https://youtu.be/GcSACxUbqtg). Keep to your course.
