## Overview

Given all the Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday deals going on at the moment, you can pick up some heavily discounted and even free courses. I found [Fundamentals of Computer Hacking](https://stackskills.com/p/fundamentals-of-computer-hacking) on Stack Social going for free along with a HTML 5 Gaming &amp; a JavaScript Course for Entrepreneurs.

Every course I go through, I find myself not only taking in the curriculum but evaluating the course itself. I can’t help but critic the teaching methods, animation, Learning Management System (LMS) and the overall experience the course provides.

The course is by an Indian company which started in 2010 called [Infy Sec](https://www.infysec.com/). From their [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infysec) – infySEC is a company that provides cyber security services to medium-sized enterprises and governments across the world. The company is located in Chennai, India, and focuses on security technology services, security consulting, security training, and research and development.

Here’s my review of the Fundamentals of Computer Hacking by [Infy Sec](https://www.infysec.com/).

## Review

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large">![Fundamentals of Computer Hacking Sales Page](https://mrash.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/fundamentals-of-computer-hacking-600.jpg)<figcaption>Fundamentals of Computer Hacking Sales Page</figcaption></figure></div>The sales page for Fundamentals of Computer Hacking is a bit bare using a basic post template. The title is clear and provides an easy to use Call To Action, the FREE is really the draw here. The sales video is a good addition but the actual content it provides is a bit confusing.

<figure class="wp-block-embed-videopress wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-wistia-inc wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/3pnthtbw6z?videoFoam=true </div></figure>The course overview shows all modules but does not provide video previews which is a shame. And the reviews are just crammed into the side-bar along with the author details. The presentation does not build a lot of confidence in the course.

Once in the course the user experience is average, giving a ‘good enough’ navigation to go between lessons. The LMS they use is [Teachable](https://teachable.com/) if you’re wondering. The information was good even if it felt lacking on the actual ‘Hacking’ side of things. It covered more basics of computers and networking.

I found the microphone is a bit low in quality which resulted in the audio being slightly distracting from time to time. Also, some videos cut between Udemy watermarks and cut to a woman voice over which was a bit jarring. It felt like two courses we’re put together or they have ripped off someone. I noticed their we’re duplicate videos even some missing videos for certain lessons. Then their we’re missing topics, like they didn’t even cover some areas, just skipped and moved on. After all of those jarring elements, it felt actually bootlegged or ripped off from another course entirely.

## Notes

**Data** is stored text, numbers, credit cards, passwords etc.  
**Information** is organised data

**Information Security** is defending data physically or digitally from attacks

**Threats** are environmental naturally or man-made from hackers  
**Hackers** are White, Grey or Black (Crackers)

**Hacking** is the act of Information Gathering, Gaining Access &amp; Anti-forensics

**Malware** is Malicious Software classified by User Mode &amp; Kernel Mode  
 **Kernel Mode** attacks Ring 0 by infecting between App &amp; OS  
 **User Mode** attacks Ring 3 which effects individual files

Categorized by **Virus, Worm, Trojan &amp; Backdoor**

**Virus** Vital Information Resource Under Siege is a piece of code affecting a system  
 **Concealer** helps it look like a normal file/code i.e. evades antivirus  
 **Payload** holds the executable instructions   
 **Replicator** creates duplicates of itself

It’s Life Cycle begins with it’s Origination which is building via a Programming Language

**Worm** is a self-propagating virus effecting multiple devices via a network  
 **Scanner** looks for vulnerabilities  
 **Penetration** looks to exploit vulnerabilities  
 **Installer** bypasses security to inject code  
 **Discovery** then looks for other devices/machines to infect

**Trojan** is a destructive piece of code disguised as a game of app  
 **Payload** which does the destructive work  
 **Concealer** prevents dedication  
 **Renaming** which renames itself as non-malicious  
 **Corruption** corrupts security software  
 **Polymorphic** code which changes itself each time it runs  
 **Wrapper** helps to run in the background and hides itself

**Backdoor** bypasses security when run and creates a **Covert Link**   
 **Overt Link** is the connection between machines  
 **Cover Link** is a hidden connection between machines

**Antivirus** is virus protection software  
  **Interactive Mode** runs in a computers background  
 **Scan Mode** monitors OS files, Registry files etc. on demand

**Information Gathering** is the preparatory phase aka reconnaissance  
 **Passive** involves gathering in-directly via web, social media etc.  
 SSH Tunnelling, HTTP Tunnelling, TOR  
 **Active** involves direct intrusion physically or on-site  
 Proxy Chains, Proxy Trojans

**Masking Identity** is hiding your machines IP Address via re-routing traffic  
 **Proxy Server** can act as an in-between node  
 **Tunnelling** is a secure channel over the net via SSH, HTTPS, L2TP

**SSH Tunnelling** is the process of creating an encrypted channel  
 **SSH** Secure Socket Shell, a protocol which connects securely via Port 22

**Email Harvesting** involves gathering mass amounts of emails via databases

**Network Hacking**

**OSI Model** Open System Interconnection is the travel of data between devices  
 Web Interface (1,2,3) &amp; Network Interface (5,6,7)  
 1. Application – Browsers, Messengers etc. via protocols HTTPS, FTP, SMTP  
 2. Presentation – OS Compatibility, Encryption, Compression  
 3. Session – Active time of user, SID (Session ID)  
 4. Transport – Mediator to send/receive data via TLH Segments (Transport Layer Header) based on TCP/UDP  
 5. Network  
 6. Datalink  
 7. Physical

**TCP** Transmission Control Protocol a connection probe  
 Source Port an Ephemeral Port on Client &gt;1024 to;  
 Destination Port on Server 0-1023 Port  
 Uses 3 Way Handshake

**Steganography** is the act of hiding data within data  
 Types: Image, Audio, Document, Whitespace, Text &amp; Email

## Overall

For a free course, it’s okay. I can’t complain as there was zero commitment to access it, but still it felt very lacking in the one area the whole course revolved around… hacking. It spent so much time on computer basics by the time it went into hacking topics it was over.

I still got value from it, some of those computer basic lessons we actually great refreshers even if I didn’t want them. I still would recommend this course as a place to start for computer basics, not cyber security. I’m on the hunt for a better course already.
