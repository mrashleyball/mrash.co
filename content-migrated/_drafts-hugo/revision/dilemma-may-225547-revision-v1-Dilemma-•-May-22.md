Hi friend,

Welcome back to the monthly newsletter, I hope you’re staying safe wherever you are around the world. How was your May 2022? Mine was slightly uneventful (like last month) and flu-ridden due to colder weather. I hope yours was better.

Let’s focus on a learning dilemma, an ongoing issue I and many face. How to continue a learning path when things get difficult and stale. *Disclaimer, this [newsletter](https://mrash.co/newsletters) is from [Mr Ash.co](https://mrashleyball.com/), as you subscribed or downloaded a freebie.

## The Learning Dilemma

Professional Development (PD) is important in education, in a way, its my job to learn. I typically focus on a course or project to learn new skills or sharpen existing ones.

Currently, I’m learning Python, a flexible, popular programming language with a beginner-friendly design. I’m learning via the online, self-paced CS50P course from Harvard. It spans 11 weeks with succinct lectures and challenging problem sets, oh and it’s 100% free. For help, there’s a discord server to ask educators and students.

What’s the dilemma? What’s so difficult?

It, got, hard, and, boring. One particular week wasn’t interesting as the previous weeks. It’s a pretty bad excuse for a learning dilemma, but I think it’s an important one.

Here’s how I’m combating the dilemma:

1. Writing this public newsletter.
2. Sharing problem set advice via the blog.
3. Tweeting some progress.
4. Just keep going.

It’s simple in the end, to not stop, to continue when it’s hard and/or boring. Sometimes there’s no ’hack’ or special trick, it’s just ‘heads down’ and study.

## Catch-Up &amp; Next Steps

*Looking back on May and forward to June.*
