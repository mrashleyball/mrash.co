Also, sidenote, when you’re up and running, if you want run OpenVPN in the background, use`sudo openvpn --daemon *.ovpn`.

## Do You Need a VPN For TryHackMe?

No, you don’t need a VPN for TryHackMe to play **all** rooms. But you do need a VPN for TryHackMe for rooms that include systems or Virtual Machines for you to interact with. It’s recommended to use a VPN for TryHackMe as you can then play any room as intended.

Some rooms require downloading files and some open websites within the TryHackMe room. So again no, you don’t need a VPN for **all** TryHackMe rooms. However, if you can in a good habit of using TryHackMe’s VPN, then you can connect to any room.

## Why Is TryHackMe Not Working?

Start with [TryHackMe’s OpenVpn Troubleshooting doc](https://docs.tryhackme.com/docs/openvpn/troubleshooting/openvpn-troubleshooting/) to gain a better idea of what’s not working. It could be openvpn not connecting, here’s a commands to try `sudo ip link set dev tun0 mtu 1200`.

Prehaps your TryHackMe failed to connect to server, try visiting [TryHackMe’s OpenVPN Troubleshooting Git Repo](https://github.com/tryhackme/openvpn-troubleshooting).

- `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tryhackme/openvpn-troubleshooting/master/thm-troubleshoot`
- `chmod +x thm-troubleshoot`
- `./thm-troubleshoot`

If you’re still having issues, make sure you only have a single OpenVPN connection, use `ifconfig` to see your network adapters. OpenVPN will open a tunnel which looks like `tun0` for example. If you see more adapters like `tun1`, `tun2`, then you want to pull those down.

- `sudo ifconfig tun1 down`

Lastly, if you’re running OpenVPN and seeing an OPTIONS ERROR: failed to negotiate cipher with server error. Try running `sed -i 's/cipher AES-256-CBC/data-ciphers AES-256-CBC/' *.ovpn` in the directory of your `ovpn` config file.
